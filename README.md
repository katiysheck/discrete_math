# discrete_math
all you need to pass the discrete math exam and the best synopsis ever (❁´◡`❁)

*_I need to tell that the first language of this synopsis is russian, so first of all I will publish ru-version, and then I will translate it in English (or you can help me instead ;)_

*_And also I will write themes out of order because I can :^)_

## In this synopsis you will understand (might be changed):

**1) Introduction to sets, basic operations**

**2) Binary relations, equivalences**

**3) Partial and linear orders**

**4) Closures, toposort, cardinalities**

**5) Introduction to λ-calculus** 

**                   **

_take a breath, I know that It's suck, you will understand soon, darling❤️
    if you don't now, It's quite OK, honestly, we all don't ;)_

_Here we go!_

**                   **

**6) Normal forms and Church-Rosser theorem**

**7) Introduction to lisp**

**8) Y -combinator and modelling power of λ-calculus**

**9) Propositional logic**

**10) Normal forms in propositional logic**

**                   **

_One more stop-station, you can think about this scary words and take a suggetion about what you will be learn_

**                   **

**11) Sequential propositional calculus**

**12) Predicate calculus**

**13) Semantics of predicate logic**

**14) Introduction to automated theorem proving**

**15) Introduction to program verification**

**16) Hoare logic and formal verification**

**                   **

... that's all for now

So, good luck young padawan!

**DIVE IN**
